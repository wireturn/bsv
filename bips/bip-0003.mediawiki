The format for Bitcoin SV (BSV) URIs is as follows:

<code>
bitcoin:[address]?sv[&][querystring]
</code>

Where:

* [address] is a base58check encoded address (the original format)

* sv is an empty parameter to denote that this is on the BSV blockchain

* [&] is an (optional) ampersand to preceed the rest of the query string (if there is more to the query string)

* [querystring] is the (optional) rest of the query string, which may include Payment Protocol parameters or anything else

The format is exactly the same as BIP 21 except that we include the empty "sv"
parameter to disambiguate BSV from BTC.
