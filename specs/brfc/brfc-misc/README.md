## RFC Notice

This repository contains miscellaneous BRFCs (Bitcoin request for comment).  BRFCs were originally described as [part of the paymail specification](http://bsvalias.org/01-brfc-specifications.html)

These draft spec is released as an RFC (request for comment) as part of the public review process. Any comments, criticisms or suggestions should be directed toward the [issues page](https://github.com/bitcoin-sv-specs/brfc-misc/issues) on this github repository.

Note that all BRFC's require a brfc-id generated according to the algorithm [described here](http://bsvalias.org/01-02-brfc-id-assignment.html) Demonstration code is available in https://github.com/bitcoin-sv-specs/brfc-misc/tree/master/brfc-id-generator
