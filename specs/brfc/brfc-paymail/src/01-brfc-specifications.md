# BRFC Specifications

BRFC (Bitcoin SV Request-For-Comments) Specifications describe functionality across the ecosystem. `bsvalias` protocols and paymail implementations are described across a series of BRFC documents.

Whilst this is not the authoritative definition of the BRFC process, a summary is included here as the BRFC process is the nominated mechanism through which extensions to the paymail system are defined and discovered during [Service Discovery](./02-service-discovery.md).

The BRFC process is a decentralised process, meaning anybody is free to propose anything without a central authority to approve the publication of new standards. In the context of paymail, implementers express their support for a proposal by actually implementing it, and advertising the endpoint(s) as part of their service discovery implementation.
