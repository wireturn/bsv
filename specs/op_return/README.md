# OP_RETURN
A central repository for various OP_RETURN protocol specifications

## Introduction

OP_RETURN is a mechanism for embedding data in the Bitcoin SV blockchain in proveably unspendable outputs.  After the OP_RETURN op code any arbitrary data can follow.

## NON-CANONICAL

No specification in this repository should be considered canonical or taking precedence over any other protocol.  The data embedded in an OP_RETURN is completely arbitrary and determined by the user.  As such there is no enforcement of any protocol rules on the format or content of this data and anyone is able to ignore any existing protocol.  These specifications are guidance only and if enforcement of protocol rules is required it must come from some other mechanism.

## NON-AUTHORITATIVE

This repository is provided and maintained as a community service.  It should NOT be considered authoritative.
