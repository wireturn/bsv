# Bitcoin SV Specification & Infrastructure Standards

The Bitcoin SV Specification precisely and completely specify the rules that define Bitcoin SV. 
These rules are commonly referred to as the Consensus Rules.

In addition to the Bitcoin Specification there are a number of Infrastructure Standards that have emerged
over the years. The P2P Network standard enables infrastructure components to communicate with each
other. The RPC Standard defines a common set of methods to control and interact with a Bitcoin node.

The target audience for these documents are IT professionals that already have a solid understanding of Bitcoin. They 
specify the details of the infrastructure layer, namely the Bitcoin SV blockchain and Bitcoin SV network. The documents 
do not describe emergent behaviour based on these specifications, nor do they describe how applications or services
may be built upon the infrastructure layer and are not intended to be used as an introduction to Bitcoin.
