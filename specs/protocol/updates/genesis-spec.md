## Introduction

This is the specification of the Genesis Upgrade. It defines the upgrade activation mechanism, the changes to the 
Bitcoin Specification and the Consensus Rules, as well as the Standard Local Policies that are recommended for client 
implementations.

This document is a specification. It is not a guide and it does not describe implementation specifics or emergent 
behaviour of the system.


## Definitions

The **Bitcoin Rules** are the precise rules which define Bitcoin. These include rules such as: the sum of the value of 
the inputs of a transaction must be greater than or equal to the sum of the values of the outputs, and the block subsidy 
schedule. These are the foundational rules of Bitcoin, irrespective of implementation.

The **Consensus Rules** are additional rules that have been reached by general agreement and are necessary to implement 
the Bitcoin Specification in software. They are needed because software has limitations and agreements are needed in 
order to facilitate integration of the software. Some Consensus Rules are configurable in the software, some are not. 
An example of a non-configurable Consensus Rule is that the version of a transaction must fit in a signed 32-bit integer. 
An example of a configurable Consensus Rule, after Genesis activation, is the maximum accepted block size.

**Local Policies** are additional controls that are implemented in software and may place additional restrictions on the 
transactions and blocks that the software will propagate to other systems and, for transactions, confirm in blocks. 
Policies are “local”, they apply to the instance of software that is running, they do not apply to the validation of 
blocks, or the transactions within a block. A block accepted from another miner may contain transactions that do not 
conform to local policy.

**Standard Policies** are common local policies that are used by client software. They are defined as a Standard to 
facilitate common application across independent software implementations but it is important to note that it is not 
required that software implement or adhere to these policies.

Throughout this specification the following words are used with specific meanings:

*   **valid** - a transaction or block is valid if it follows the Bitcoin and Consensus rules.
*   **invalid** - a transaction or block is invalid if it does not follow either the Bitcoin or Consensus rules.
*   **rejected** - a transaction or block may be rejected by an implementation due to a Policy. The implementation may not have determined whether the transaction or block was valid or invalid.

Throughout this specification the metric system is used. One KB is one kilobyte which is 1,000 bytes.

## Upgrade Activation Mechanism

The Genesis Upgrade will activate at the block heights defined in the table below.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>Mainnet
   </td>
   <td><p style="text-align: right">
620,538</p>

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Testnet
   </td>
   <td><p style="text-align: right">
1,344,302</p>

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Scaling Test Network
   </td>
   <td><p style="text-align: right">
14,896</p>

   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Regtest
   </td>
   <td><p style="text-align: right">
10,000</p>

   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

The upgraded Bitcoin Rules, Consensus Rules, and Policies become active in the block that is mined at this height.

## UTXO Height Rule Determination

The Genesis Upgrade introduces the “UTXO Height” mechanism for determining the Bitcoin Rules, Consensus Rules, and 
Policies that are to be applied to a transaction. The purpose of this mechanism is to maintain compatibility for UTXO’s 
that were created under the previous version of the Bitcoin Rules and Consensus Rules.

Every output of a transaction is evaluated under the rules that are in effect for the block in which the transaction is 
being confirmed. If a transaction is confirmed in a block that has a height which is greater or equal to the Genesis 
activation height, then the outputs of that transaction must comply with the Genesis Upgrade. If a transaction is 
confirmed in a block that has a height which is less than the Genesis activation height, then the outputs of that 
transaction must comply with the rules prior to the Genesis Upgrade.

Every input of a transaction is evaluated under either the rules prior to the Genesis Upgrade, or the Genesis Upgrade 
rules, depending on whether the UTXO that is being spent by the input was, or will be, confirmed prior to the Genesis 
activation height or after the Genesis activation height. If the transaction which contains the UTXO that is being spent 
was, or will be, confirmed in a block before the Genesis activation height then the input script and the output script 
for the UTXO being spent by that input are evaluated according to rules prior to the Genesis Upgrade. If the transaction 
which contains the UTXO that is being spent was, or will be, confirmed in a block with a height greater than or equal to 
the Genesis activation height, then the input script and the output script for the UTXO being spent by that input are 
evaluated according to the Genesis Upgrade.

Other characteristics of the transaction, such as the maximum number of sigops, are evaluated according to the rules 
that are in effect for the block in which the transaction is being confirmed.

It is worth noting that, after Genesis activation, a single transaction may spend inputs from before Genesis activation 
and after Genesis activation, in which case each input is evaluated under the rules that are applicable to that input 
based upon the block height that the transaction referenced by that input was confirmed.

## Changes to the Bitcoin Specification
 
### Block Consensus Rules
These consensus rules apply to blocks that are produced after Genesis activation.
 
#### Block Size Consensus Rule
The size of a block is the size in bytes of the serialized form of the block, including the block header and all of the 
transactions confirmed by the block[^1].

The consensus rule that restricts the maximum size of a block to a specific number of bytes has been converted into a 
configurable consensus rule. The default value of the maximum acceptable size of a block is unlimited. 

**Miners are expected to reach consensus on this value and configure it manually.**
 
#### Number of CheckSig Operations per MB of Block Space
The consensus rule that limits the number of checksig operations per megabyte of block space has been removed. 

### Transaction Consensus Rules
These consensus rules apply to transactions that are confirmed in blocks after Genesis activation.

#### Maximum Transaction Size
The size of a transaction is the size in bytes of the serialized form of the transaction[^2].

The maximum size of a transaction is 1GB (1,000,000,000 bytes). This limitation is expected to be lifted in the future.

#### Maximum Number of CheckSig Operations per Transaction
The consensus rule that limits the number of checksig operations per transaction has been removed.

#### nLockTime & nSequence
After Genesis activation, the functionality of the nLockTime field of a transaction and the nSequence fields of 
transaction inputs revert to their original purpose. The rules defined here only apply to transactions that are 
confirmed after Genesis activation.

The nSequence fields of every transaction input and the nLockTime field of the transaction collectively determine the 
“finality” of a transaction. If a transaction is “non-final” then it can not be valid but it can become “final” at a 
later time. If a transaction is “final” then it can be valid.

*   If the value of nSequence of a transaction input is 0xFFFFFFFF then that input is a “final input”.
*   If the value of nSequence of a transaction input is not 0xFFFFFFFF then that input is a “non-final input”.
*   If all of the inputs of a transaction are “final inputs” then the transaction is “final”, irrespective of the value of the nLockTime field.
*   If one or more of the inputs of a transaction are “non-final inputs” then:
    *   If the value of the transactions nLockTime field is less than 500,000,000 then the field represents a block height. 
        *   If the height of the block in which the transaction is being confirmed is greater or equal to the value of this field, then the transaction is “final”. 
        *   Otherwise the transaction is “non-final”
    *   If the value of the transactions nLockTime field is greater or equal to 500,000,000 then the field represents a UNIX epoch timestamp. 
        *   If the MTP of the last 11 blocks is greater or equal to the value of this field, then the transaction is “final”.
        *   Otherwise, the transaction is “non-final”.

A “final” transaction may be confirmed in a block following the “first-seen” rule.

A new transaction must replace a prior “non-final” transaction if it has the same inputs in the same order and every 
sequence number for every input in the new transaction is not less than the sequence number for the corresponding input 
in the prior transaction and the sequence number of at least one input in the new transaction is greater than the 
sequence number for the corresponding input in the prior transaction.

If a new transaction is detected which does not fulfill all of these requirements then it must be rejected.

If a new transaction is detected which has inputs that conflict with the inputs of a “non-final” transaction, but which 
are not identical to the inputs of the “non-final” transaction, then the “non-final” transaction is the “first seen” 
transaction and takes priority over the new transaction.

### Script Language Rules
Bitcoin Script is the programming language that is used to lock and unlock transaction outputs. This section contains 
changes to the Script Language Rules.

The rules defined here apply to locking and unlocking scripts for transactions outputs that are created after the 
Genesis activation. The previous rules apply to transaction outputs created prior to Genesis activation.

#### Data Types
All data items in Bitcoin Script are a byte sequence. Some operations interpret their parameters as numeric or boolean 
values and require the item to fulfill the requirements of those types. Some operations produce items on the stack which 
are valid numeric or boolean values.

A byte sequence has a length and a value. The length of the byte sequence must be an integer greater or equal to zero 
and less than or equal to 2^32-1 (UINT32_MAX).

The byte sequence of length zero is called the “null value”.

Any data item can be interpreted as a boolean value. If the data item consists entirely of bytes with value zero, or the 
data item is the null value, then the boolean value of the item is **false**. Otherwise, the boolean value of the item 
is **true**.

A data item can be interpreted as a numeric value. The numeric value is encoded in a byte sequence using little-endian 
notation. The byte sequence of length zero (the null value) is the standard representation for the numeric value zero. 
There is a Consensus Rule on the maximum size of a numeric value that is defined below. 

#### Formal Grammar for Bitcoin Script

A formal grammar has been defined for Bitcoin Script. This section of the document defines that grammar but it does not 
describe how this definition is applied. The application of the grammar definition is described in further parts of this 
document. 

This grammar is fully described by the following BNF grammar:

```
<script> ::= <unlocking-script> <locking-script>
<unlocking-script> ::= <constants> | <empty>
<locking-script> ::= <script-block> ["OP_RETURN" <non-script-data>]

    "OP_2MUL" | "OP_2DIV" | "OP_VERIF" | "OP_VERNOTIF"
<non-script-data> ::= any sequence of bytes
```
It’s worth highlighting the following features of this formal grammar:

*   The complete script consists of two sections, the unlocking script and the locking script. The locking script is 
    included in the transaction output that is being spent, the unlocking script is included in the transaction input 
    that is spending the output.
*   The unlocking script can only contain constants. This requirement is part of Validity of Script Consensus Rule, 
    defined later.
*   A branching operator (OP_IF or OP_NOTIF) must have a matching OP_ENDIF.
*   An OP_ELSE can only be included between a branching operator and OP_ENDIF pair. There can only be at most one 
    OP_ELSE between a branching operator and an OP_ENDIF.
*   OP_RETURN may appear at any location in a valid script. The functionality of OP_RETURN has been restored and is 
    defined later in the section OP_RETURN Functionality. Grammatically, any bytes after an OP_RETURN that is not in a 
    branch block are not evaluated and there are no grammatical requirements for those bytes.
*   Note that disabled operations are included in this grammar. A disabled operation is grammatically correct but will 
    produce a failure if executed.

#### Validity of Script Consensus Rule

The locking and unlocking scripts for every input of a transaction must be grammatically valid, as defined by the formal 
grammar above.

Note that this includes the requirement that unlocking scripts only contain PUSHDATA operations.

Also note that the scripts must be grammatically valid when they are spent. It is not required that the output scripts 
of a transaction are grammatically valid although it is highly recommended that client software implement this restriction as a policy.

#### PUSHDATA Only in Unlocking Script Consensus Rule

After Genesis activation, the unlocking scripts used in transaction inputs may only contain PUSHDATA operations, as 
defined by the formal grammar above.

In contrast to all the other updates in this section, this consensus rule is activated for all inputs of transactions 
that are, or will be, confirmed in a block after Genesis activation, regardless of the height of the UTXO being spent.

This rule is a subset of the Validity of Script Consensus Rule defined above but is included separately because the 
activation conditions are different.

#### Disabled Operations Consensus Rule

The following operations are disabled: OP_2MUL, OP_2DIV, OP_VERIF, OP_VERNOTIF.

Although these operations are grammatically correct and can appear in valid Script, their execution will cause script 
failure and therefore transaction invalidity. If they are present in un-executed script, the script execution may 
succeed.

**It is very strongly recommended that these operations not be used at all until they are activated.**

#### Script Element Size Consensus Rule
 
The consensus rule that limits the maximum size of a script element has been removed.

The functionality previously provided by this consensus rule is now covered by the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule.

#### Stack Size Consensus Rule
The consensus rule that limits the combined number of elements that can be placed on the stack, and the altstack, has 
been removed.

The functionality previously provided by this consensus rule is now covered by the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule.

#### Script Size Consensus Rule
The consensus rule that limits the maximum size of a script has been removed.

The functionality previously provided by this consensus rule is now covered by the Maximum Transaction Size Consensus 
Rule and the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule.

#### Numeric Value Size Consensus Rule

For a byte sequence to validly represent a numeric value, the length of the byte sequence must be less than or equal to 
750,000 bytes. A byte sequence that is larger than this is a valid byte sequence but is not a valid numeric value.

Note that while some operations require parameters to be valid numeric values, they may produce byte sequences which are 
not valid numeric values (for example, OP_MUL may produce a byte sequence which is too large to validly represent a 
numeric value).

#### Number of Public Keys per Multisig Consensus Rule

The consensus rule that limits the number of public keys per multisig has been changed to be 2^31-1 (INT32_MAX).

#### Number of Non-Push Operations Per Script Consensus Rule

The consensus rule that limits the number of non-push operations per script has been removed.

The functionality previously provided by this consensus rule is now covered by the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule 
while other capabilities manage the cost of execution.

#### Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule

The stack memory usage consensus rule limits the amount of memory that can be used on the stacks. This rule is evaluated 
against the sum of the memory used by the stack and the memory used by the altstack.

If the execution of the unlocking and locking script for an input uses more stack memory than defined in this rule, then 
the transaction is invalid.

The memory usage of a stack is calculated using a specific formula, so that it can be coordinated across software 
implementations. The formula for calculating the memory usage of a stack is:

`usage = sum of (for each element: 32 + size in bytes of element)`

where `"size in bytes of element"` is the size in bytes of the element when serialized in the Bitcoin Serialization Format.

This is a configurable consensus rule, with a default value that is formally unlimited but will in practice depend on 
the capabilities of the system that is evaluating the script. 

**Miners are expected to reach consensus on this value and configure it manually.**

#### Sunset P2SH

Pay to script hash (P2SH) is a capability that was added to Bitcoin in 2012 by BIP13. It assigns a special meaning to a 
specific output script template. If the specific script template is present in the script of an output that is being 
spent by an input then it is treated in a different way, rather than being executed normally. 

The p2sh script template is identified as `OP_HASH160 <20 bytes data> OP_EQUAL`, or in hex `a914 <20 bytes data> 87`, 
where the 20 bytes of data will vary depending on the redeem script being used.

The P2SH capability is being removed by the Genesis Upgrade and the presence of a p2sh script template in an output will 
invalidate a transaction. 

#### OP_RETURN Functionality

The functionality of the OP_RETURN operation is being restored. OP_RETURN will cause termination of the script and the 
validity of the script is determined by the value of the top item on the stack.
 
#### Sunset OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY & OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
 
OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY are operations that were introduced by BIP0065 and BIP0112.

These operations revert to NOP’s, which have no effect. 

However, most implementations have a local policy which rejects scripts that contain “upgradeable NOPs”, including 
these, and will reject transactions containing these operations. 

## Standard Local Policies

Policies are settings that are configured by software operators. These settings are generally required by software 
implementations. It is expected that as implementations of the software mature that these settings will be adjusted.

Policies control which transactions the software will propagate across the P2P network or include in a block. However, 
policies are not Bitcoin Rules or Consensus Rules and are not used to determine the validity of blocks or the 
transactions confirmed by a block.

Four new standard policies have been defined as part of the Genesis Upgrade and one prior policy has been changed. These 
policies are listed below. It must be noted that this is not an exhaustive list of all standard policies, many of the 
policies that were standard before the Genesis Upgrade have been retained.

### Standard Local Transaction Policies

#### Maximum Acceptable Transaction Size Policy

The maximum acceptable transaction size is a standard policy that configures the largest transactions that the software 
will propagate across the P2P network or include in a block. 

The value of this configuration item must be less than or equal to the value of the Maximum Transaction Size Consensus 
Rule or it will have no effect

The default value for this policy setting is 10MB (10,000,000 bytes).

#### Transaction Evaluation Timeout

The transaction evaluation timeout is a standard policy that defines the maximum amount of time that the software will 
allow for the evaluation of a transaction before terminating the evaluation and rejecting the transaction. This setting 
is always defined with a time unit and the default value is 1 second.

This policy applies to transactions that are received by the software and its processes for determining whether the 
transaction should be propagated across the P2P network or included in a block. The policy does not apply to the 
evaluation of transactions in a confirmed block.

Note that:

*   if the evaluation of a transaction is terminated due to exceeding the timeout limit then the software has not 
    determined whether the transaction is valid or invalid, it has merely decided not to make that determination;
*   the time taken to evaluate a transaction by a particular system will vary based on the software used, the resources 
    available, and other dynamic factors such as the load on the system. It is not an exact measurement.

### Standard Local Script Language Policies

Script Language Policies apply to the execution of script.

It must be noted that there are existing policies regarding the representation of numeric values in byte sequences, in 
particular the minimal encoding policy. These policies have not been changed as part of the Genesis Upgrade and are not 
documented here.

#### Numeric Value Length

The length of numeric value policy defines the maximum length of a byte sequence to be considered a valid numeric value. 
The default value for this policy is 250,000 bytes.

Transactions which contain script that consume numeric values that are larger than this policy setting will be rejected; 
they will not be propagated across the P2P network or included in a block.

#### Stack Memory Usage Policy

The stack memory usage policy limits the amount of memory that can be used on the stacks. This policy is evaluated 
against the sum of the memory used by the stack and the memory used by the altstack.

If the execution of the unlocking and locking script for an input uses more stack memory than defined in this policy, 
then the transaction is rejected.

The memory usage of a stack is calculated using the same formula described in the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule 
(above). 

The default value for this policy is 100MB (100,000,000 bytes). The value of this policy must be less than or equal to 
the value of the Stack Memory Usage Consensus Rule.

### Standard Local P2P Network Policies

#### Propagation of non-Standard Transactions

The local policy on the Propagation of non-standard transactions controls whether the software will propagate 
non-standard transactions to other peers on the P2P network.

Before Genesis Activation, the default setting for this policy is that non-standard transactions will not be propagated 
across the P2P Network.

After Genesis Activation, the default setting for this policy is that non-standard transactions will be propagated 
across the P2P Network.

Note that even though non-standard transactions will be propagated across the P2P Network after Genesis activation, 
other policies such as the Maximum Acceptable Transaction Size Policy remain in effect.

## Notes

[^1]:
     Note that the size of a block does not include the size of any messaging envelope that may encapsulate the block, 
     such as the message header in the P2P networking standard.

     Footnote 1 also applies to transactions.
