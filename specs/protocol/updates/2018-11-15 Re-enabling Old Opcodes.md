# Specification for Re-enabling old Opcodes
November 2018 Bitcoin release.

Version 1.0, 2018-08-13

## Introduction
In May 2018 several disabled opcodes were reintroduced to the Bitcoin Cash scripting engine2.  The scope of that change 
was limited in order to focus developer attention rather than attempting to reintroduce all of the disabled opcodes at 
once.  This specification expands upon that change by reintroducing additional opcodes.

This specifications describes the opcodes that will be added in the November 2018 protocol upgrade.

The opcodes to be added are:

| Word   | OpCode | Hex  | Input | Output | Description |
|--------|--------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| OP_MUL | 149    | 0x95 | n1 n2 | out    | Multiplies two numbers |
| OP_RSHIFT | 153 | 0x99 | b n | out | Right shift b by n bits |
| OP_LSHIFT | 152 | 0x98 | b n | out | Left shift b by n bits |
| OP_INVERT | 131 | 0x83 | b | out | Bitwise NOT |

### Data types
Script data values are byte sequences but may be interpreted as numeric values by some opcodes. Specification of the 
data types used by Script is beyond the scope of this document.

For accuracy in this specification, byte sequence values are represented as a sequence of byte values surrounded by 
curly brackets, such as  {0x01, 0x02, 0x03}. This sequence is three bytes long, it begins with a byte of value 1 and 
ends with a byte of value 3.

Numeric data values are represented in this document as decimal numbers, such as 35315.
 
In this specification, a variable representing a byte sequence is named using the symbol b. A variable representing a 
numeric value is named using the symbol n.
 
### Overflow
Conceptually overflow means that the result of the operation is out-of-bounds.
 
For consistency with previous opcodes and to avoid exposing underlying implementation details, all of the opcodes 
defined in this document give no indication of overflow.

Note that divide by zero is a separate error and reported as such.

### Definitions
Operand order: In keeping with convention, where multiple operands are specified the top most stack item is the last 
operand. For example:
 * n1 n2 OP_MUL → out
 
is the same as

1. Push n1 onto stack
1. Push n2 onto stack
1. Execute OP_MUL

The result is that n2 and n1 are popped from the stack and replaced by out.

### Global Conditions
The following conditions apply to all opcodes. These conditions must be checked by the implementation to ensure that no 
violations occur:

1. for all b : elements on the stack, 0 <= len(b) <= MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE
1. for each opcode, the prerequisite number of operands are present on the stack when the opcode is executed

These unit tests should be included for every opcode:

1. Executing the opcode with an input element of length greater than MAX_SCRIPT_ELEMENT_SIZE fails.
1. Executing the opcode with an insufficient number of operands on the stack fails.

### Operand Consumption
In all cases the opcode and operand stack elements are consumed by the opcode and replaced with the output.

## Arithmetic Operators

### OP_MUL
Opcode (decimal): 149

Opcode (hex): 0x95

Description: Multiply two operands.

n1 n2 OP_MUL →  out, where out is the product (multiplication) of n1 and n2.

Examples:

* 4  7 OP_MUL → 28
* -4 7 OP_MUL → -28

Any overflow is ignored. The result of the opcode may be a byte sequence that is too large to be interpreted as a 
numeric value.

Impact of successful execution:

* The number of elements on stack is reduced by one.

#### Unit Tests

1. b1 b2 OP_MUL -> FAIL - where b1 is not a valid numerical value or b2 is not a valid numerical value, or both
1. The following test will be repeated with various values for n1 and n2. The values of n1 and n2 must include values 
which have byte sequence representations of size 1 to 4 bytes inclusive. The tests will be repeated with values n1,n2 
and -n1,n2 and n1,-n2 and -n1,-n2.

    1. n1 n2 OP_MUL → n1*n2
    1. n1 1 OP_MUL → n1  
    1. n1 0 OP_MUL → 0
1. n1 n2 OP_MUL -> b - where (n1 * n2) is too large to be represented in 4 bytes. The result b must be a byte sequence 
which is a representation of (n1*n2) but larger than 4 bytes.

## Bitwise Operators
The result produced by these opcodes is always the same size as the operand.

The execution cost of these opcodes is proportional to the length of the operand.

### OP_RSHIFT
Opcode (decimal): 153

Opcode (hex): 0x99

Description: Right shift b by n bits.

b n OP_RSHIFT →  out, where out is the byte sequence created by a right shift of the binary bit pattern b by n bits.

There is no limit imposed on the value of n except that n must be a valid numerical value and must be non-negative. 
If n is negative, the script fails.

If n is greater than the number of bits in the byte sequence, the result is a zero filled byte sequence equal in length 
to the original byte sequence. This is consistent with the interpretation of b n OP_RSHIFT as equal to b 1 OP_RSHIFT 
repeated n times.

Impact of successful execution:
* The number of elements on stack is reduced by one.

#### Unit Tests
These tests may be repeated with a number of values for b and n.
1. b 0 OP_RSHIFT → b.
2. b n OP_RSHIFT → out with for various n > 0, including when n > len(b)
3. b n OP_RSHIFT → fails with error with n < 0

### OP_LSHIFT

Opcode (decimal): 152

Opcode (hex): 0x98

Description: Left shift b by n bits.

b n OP_LSHIFT →  out, where out is the byte sequence created by a left shift of binary bit pattern b by n bits.

There is no limit imposed on the value of n except that n must be a valid numerical value and must be non-negative. 
If n is negative, the script fails.

If n is greater than the number of bits in the byte sequence, the result is a zero filled byte sequence equal in length 
to the original byte sequence. This is consistent with the interpretation of b n OP_LSHIFT as equal to b 1 OP_LSHIFT 
repeated n times.

Impact of successful execution:
* The number of elements on stack is reduced by one.

#### Unit Tests
These tests must be repeated with a number of values for b and n.
1. b 0 OP_LSHIFT → b
1. b n OP_LSHIFT → out with for various n > 0, including when n > len(b)
1. b n OP_LSHIFT → fails with error with n < 0

### OP_INVERT

Opcode (decimal): 131

Opcode (hex): 0x83

Description: Bitwise invert.

b OP_INVERT → out, where out is b bitwise inverted.

Impact of successful execution:
* The number of elements on stack is unchanged.

#### Unit Tests
1. {} OP_INVERT → {}  
1. b OP_INVERT → bitwise invert(x) for various b and various sizes of b.
E.g. {0x80, 0x12, 0x34} → {0x7F, 0xED, 0xCB}
