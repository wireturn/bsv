// Package errs contains optional error types that implement all error behaviours defined in lathos.
//
// These are for convenience and mean you can opt to use these concrete types
// rather than implement your own as long as you are prepared to be tied to their implementation details.
//
// If your project is large it's recommended that you implement your own types based off the lathos interfaces.
